# SQL Fundamentals

## What is SQL?
**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is a standard programming language specifically designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. This language enables users to create, read, update, and delete data within a database. Most professionals pronounce the name as "sequel" or simply by its initials "S-Q-L".

## Why learn SQL?

* **Talk to Data:** SQL is essential for anyone working with data, as it provides a powerful and efficient way to interact with databases.
* **Industry Standard:** It is widely used across various industries for data analysis, reporting, and application development.
* **Career Prospects:** Many high-demand job roles require SQL knowledge, including:
    * **Software Developer:** Designs and maintains applications that store and retrieve data.
    * **Data Analyst:** Collects and analyzes large datasets to extract meaningful insights.
    * **Data Scientist:** Uses algorithms and machine learning to interpret complex data sets.
    * **Data Engineer:** Builds and maintains the infrastructure for data processing.
* **Tool Integration:** Professional tools like PowerBI, Tableau, KAFKA, Spark, and Synapse all use SQL to interact with data.

## What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. 
* **Scalability:** While Excel or .txt files work for small data, databases are designed to handle large volumes and complex queries.
* **Professionalism:** It is a secure and professional way to manage data.

### DBMS (Database Management System)
A DBMS is the software that enables users to create, manage, and interact with databases.
* **Connections:** People, Applications, and Power BI connect to the DBMS.
* **Hosting:** Servers host the DBMS, either in the Cloud or On-Premises.

### Key Vocabulary:
* **Database:** Where data is stored.
* **SQL:** The language used to speak to the database.
* **DBMS:** The software used to manage the database.
* **Server:** Where the database lives.

for Obisidian:
Database :: Stores Data
SQL :: Speak to Database
DBMS :: Manage Database
Server :: Where Databse Lives

## Database Types

### Relational Databases (RDBMS)
These store data in tables with rows and columns. SQL is primarily used with these systems.
* **Examples:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.

### NoSQL Databases
Designed for unstructured data and flexible schemas.
* **Key-Value Stores:** Data stored as pairs (e.g., Redis, Amazon DynamoDB).
* **Column-Based:** Data stored in columns rather than rows (e.g., Apache Cassandra, HBase).
* **Graph Databases:** Data stored in structures with nodes and edges (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune).
* **Document-Based:** Data stored as documents, often in JSON or XML (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB).

## Database Structure
* A **Server** can host multiple **Databases**.
* **Databases** can have multiple **Schemas** (Tables).
* A **Table** is made up of rows and columns:
    * **Column:** Represents a specific attribute.
    * **Row:** Represents a single record.
    * **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record.
    * **Value:** The actual data stored in a cell.

### Data Types:
* **Numeric:** Integer (1, 2, 30), Float, Decimal (3.14, 100.50).
* **Text (Strings):** Char, Varchar, Text ('Maria', 'Hello World').
* **Date and Time:** Date ('2025-10-30'), Time ('09:30:00'), Timestamp.
